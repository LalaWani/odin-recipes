Build a basic recipe website/ include a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Put all working knowledge of HTMl information into practice from 
beginning to end. Create:
odin-recipes repo in github
cd into odin-recipes
set up a README.md via *touch README.md* *describe the current project and skills demonstrated once the project is completed*

Added Three recipes via relative links with each link there is a JPG attached to show what the recipe makes. I used HTML to utilize different size and formats for a Heading and the font as well. This project also showcases that I have mastered ordered & unordered lists.
