<h3>This is a recipe created by Russian German immigrants. 
    It is very popular in the Nebraska, South Dakota region where 
    I am from. Cabbage and ground beef are encased in a neat 
    little bread package.</h3>

    <h4>
        Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>3 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
            <li>5 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 large head cabbage, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Divide each loaf of frozen bread dough into 6 pieces, 
            and roll into balls. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a large pot over medium 
            heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off 
            grease. Add the water, cabbage, onion, and garlic. 
            Cook over medium-low heat, stirring as needed, until 
            the cabbage is soft. Season with salt and pepper to 
            taste. I like to use more pepper than salt. Drain off 
            any excess liquids, and set aside.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough balls 
            into 5 inch (approximate) squares. Place about 3/4 
            cup of the cabbage burger into the center, fold the 
            dough over, and pinch to seal. Place on a baking 
            sheet with the seam side down.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or 
            until golden brown. Remove from the oven, and brush 
            with melted butter. Serve hot.</li>
